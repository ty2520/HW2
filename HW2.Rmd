## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(readxl)
```


```{r}
pols_month_data = read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv")
unemployment_data = read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv")
snp_data = read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv")
```


```{r}
```
# Question 1
First, clean the data in pols-month.csv. Use separate() to break up the variable mon into integer variables year, month, and day; replace month number with month name; create a president variable taking values gop and dem, and remove prez_dem and prez_gop; and remove the day variable.
```{r}
pols_month_data = 
  janitor::clean_names(pols_month_data) |>
  separate(mon,c("year","month","day")) |>
  mutate( month = month.name[as.numeric(month)]) |>
  mutate(
    president = case_when(
      prez_dem == 1 ~ "dem",
      prez_gop == 1 ~ "gop",
    )
  )|>
  select(-prez_dem, -prez_gop, - day)
```

Second, clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the above. For consistency across datasets, arrange according to year and month, and organize so that year and month are the leading columns.
```{r}
snp_data = janitor::clean_names(snp_data) |>
  separate(date,c("day","month","year")) |>
  mutate( month = month.name[as.numeric(month)]) |>
  relocate(c(year, month), .before = day) |>
  mutate(year = paste0("20", year)) |>
  select(-day)
```

Third, tidy the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the previous datasets. This process will involve switching from “wide” to “long” format; ensuring that key variables have the same name; and ensuring that key variables take the same values.
```{r}
unemployment_data = janitor::clean_names(unemployment_data) |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -year,
    names_to = "month",         
    values_to = "unemployment_rate", 
    names_prefix = ""
  )
month_name_mapping <- c(
  "jan" = "January",
  "feb" = "February",
  "mar" = "March",
  "apr" = "April",
  "may" = "May",
  "jun" = "June",
  "jul" = "July",
  "aug" = "August",
  "sep" = "September",
  "oct" = "October",
  "nov" = "November",
  "dec" = "December"
)
unemployment_data = 
  unemployment_data |>
  mutate(month = month_name_mapping[month])
  
```

Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment into the result.
```{r}
merged_pols_snp <- merge(pols_month_data, snp_data, by = c('year', 'month'), all.x = TRUE)
final_merged_data <- merge(merged_pols_snp, unemployment_data, by = c('year', 'month'), all.x = TRUE)
```

Write a short paragraph about these datasets. Explain briefly what each dataset contained, and describe the resulting dataset (e.g. give the dimension, range of years, and names of key variables).
```{r}
colnames(final_merged_data)
range(final_merged_data$year)
```

The dataset "pols-month" comprises 822 observations and 9 variables, providing insights into the political landscape in the United States. The variables include "mon" (date of the count), indicators for whether the president was Republican or Democratic ("prez_gop" and "prez_dem").
The dataset "snp" consists of 787 observations and 2 variables, focusing on the performance of the Standard & Poor's stock market index (S&P).
Lastly, the dataset "unemployment" encompasses 68 observations with 13 variables. It tracks unemployment percentages for each month of the year, from January to December, over multiple years. 
This merged dataset has 985 observation of 12 variables and combines political, economic, and stock market data from 1947 to 2015. The merged dataset contains columns "year", "month", "gov_gop", "sen_gop", "rep_gop", "gov_dem", "sen_dem", "rep_dem", "president", "day" , "close", "unemployment_rate"


# Question 2
```{r}
trash_wheel_data <- read_excel("~/Desktop/P8105/HW2/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
                               sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel")
```

## Tidying Mr.Trash Wheel data
```{r}
trash_wheel_data = janitor::clean_names(trash_wheel_data) |>
  mutate(
    homes_powered = weight_tons * 500 / 30
  ) |>
  drop_na(trash_wheel_data$dumpster) |>
  mutate(
    trash_wheel_info = "Mr. Trash Wheel"
         )|>
  mutate(
    year = as.numeric(year)
  )
   
```

## Tidying professor trash wheel data
```{r}
professor_trash_df = read_excel("~/Desktop/P8105/HW2/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
                               sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(
    homes_powered = weight_tons * 500 / 30
  ) |>
  drop_na(dumpster) |>
  mutate(
    trash_wheel_info = "professor"
         ) |>
  mutate(
    year = as.numeric(year)
  )
  
```

## Tidying Gwynnda data
```{r}
Gwynnda_trash_df = read_excel("~/Desktop/P8105/HW2/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
                               sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(
    homes_powered = weight_tons * 500 / 30
  ) |>
  drop_na(dumpster) |>
  mutate(
    trash_wheel_info = "Gwynnda"
         )|>
  mutate(
    year = as.numeric(year)
  )
```

## Combine three tidied dataframe
```{r}
trash_wheel_combined <- bind_rows(
  trash_wheel_data, professor_trash_df, Gwynnda_trash_df
)
sum(professor_trash_df$weight_tons)
july_2021_ciga <- trash_wheel_combined |>
  filter(trash_wheel_info == "Gwynnda", year == 2021, month == "July") |>
  select(cigarette_butts)
sum(july_2021_ciga)
```

The combined dataset comprises trash information collected by three distinct entities: Mr. Trash Wheel, Professor Trash Wheel, and Gwynnda. In total, the dataset includes 846 observations, each providing valuable insights into the trash collected by these entities. Key variables in this dataset include "trash_wheel_info," which identifies the entity responsible for the collection; date information indicating the date of collection; and various trash-related variables such as "total_weight" and "cigarette_butts."  Professor Trash Wheel collected 216.26 tons of trash. Furthermore, Gwynnda collected 16,300 cigarette butts during July 2021. This combined dataset serves as a comprehensive record of the environmental impact and cleanup efforts of these dedicated entities.

# Question 3
Ensure that sex and APOE4 carrier status are appropriate encoded (i.e. not numeric), and remove any participants who do not meet the stated inclusion criteria (i.e. no MCI at baseline). 
```{r}
baseline_data = read_csv("~/Desktop/P8105/HW2/data_mci/MCI_baseline.csv", skip = 1, na = ".") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(sex = ifelse(sex == 1, "Male", "Female"))|>
  mutate(apoe4 = ifelse(apoe4 == 1, "carrier", "non-carrier"))
no_baseline_removed = baseline_data |>
  filter(
    current_age <  age_at_onset | is.na(age_at_onset)
  )
```
When importing the data, I skipped the first row since it is column description. I also set "." to NA values for my future cleaning process.


How many participants were recruited, and of these how many develop MCI? What is the average baseline age? What proportion of women in the study are APOE4 carriers?
```{r}
nrow(baseline_data)
MCI_developed = baseline_data |>
    filter(
    (current_age <  age_at_onset)
  )

nrow(MCI_developed)
mean(baseline_data$current_age)

female_APOE4_carrier <- baseline_data |>
  filter(
    sex == "Female" & apoe4 == "carrier"
  )
female <- baseline_data |>
  filter(
    sex == "Female"
  )
nrow(female_APOE4_carrier) / nrow(female)
```
483 participants were recruited. 93 of these developed MCI. The average baseline age is 65.05.
0.299 of women in the study are APOE4 carriers

```{r}
mci_amyloid_data <- read_csv("data_mci/mci_amyloid.csv", skip = 1) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(
    id = study_id
  )|>
  select(- study_id)

```
When importing the data, I skipped the first row since it is column description. The dataset recorded time (in years) elapsed since the study baseline to the visit where biomarker Amyloid _ 42/40 ratio was measured

```{r}
baseline_unique <- no_baseline_removed |>
  anti_join(
    mci_amyloid_data, by = "id"
  )
nrow(baseline_unique)
amyloid_unique <- mci_amyloid_data |>
  anti_join(
    no_baseline_removed, by = "id"
  )
nrow(amyloid_unique)
```

8 participants appear in only the baseline dataset and 16 participants appear in only the amyloid dataset.

```{r}
combined_data <- inner_join(no_baseline_removed,mci_amyloid_data, by = "id")
```

The resulting data set contains information for 471 participants that appeared both in the demographic and biomarker datasets. The dataset contains information about their demographic information and time (in years) elapsed since the study baseline to the visit where biomarker Amyloid _ 42/40 ratio was measured.

```{r}
file_path <- "/Users/yutongxi/Desktop/P8105/HW2/data_mci/combined_data.csv"
write_csv(combined_data, file = file_path)
```
