## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
pols_month_data = read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv")
unemployment_data = read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv")
snp_data = read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv")
```
# Question 1
First, clean the data in pols-month.csv. Use separate() to break up the variable mon into integer variables year, month, and day; replace month number with month name; create a president variable taking values gop and dem, and remove prez_dem and prez_gop; and remove the day variable.
```{r}
pols_month_data = 
  janitor::clean_names(pols_month_data) |>
  separate(mon,c("year","month","day")) |>
  mutate( month = month.name[as.numeric(month)]) |>
  mutate(
    president = case_when(
      prez_dem == 1 ~ "dem",
      prez_gop == 1 ~ "gop",
    )
  )|>
  select(-prez_dem, -prez_gop, - day)
```

Second, clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the above. For consistency across datasets, arrange according to year and month, and organize so that year and month are the leading columns.
```{r}
snp_data = janitor::clean_names(snp_data) |>
  separate(date,c("day","month","year")) |>
  mutate( month = month.name[as.numeric(month)]) |>
  relocate(c(year, month), .before = day) |>
  mutate(year = paste0("20", year)) |>
  select(-day)
```

Third, tidy the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the previous datasets. This process will involve switching from “wide” to “long” format; ensuring that key variables have the same name; and ensuring that key variables take the same values.
```{r}
unemployment_data = janitor::clean_names(unemployment_data) |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -year,
    names_to = "month",         
    values_to = "unemployment_rate", 
    names_prefix = ""
  )
month_name_mapping <- c(
  "jan" = "January",
  "feb" = "February",
  "mar" = "March",
  "apr" = "April",
  "may" = "May",
  "jun" = "June",
  "jul" = "July",
  "aug" = "August",
  "sep" = "September",
  "oct" = "October",
  "nov" = "November",
  "dec" = "December"
)
unemployment_data = 
  unemployment_data |>
  mutate(month = month_name_mapping[month])
  
```

Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment into the result.
```{r}
merged_pols_snp <- merge(pols_month_data, snp_data, by = c('year', 'month'), all.x = TRUE)
final_merged_data <- merge(merged_pols_snp, unemployment_data, by = c('year', 'month'), all.x = TRUE)
```

Write a short paragraph about these datasets. Explain briefly what each dataset contained, and describe the resulting dataset (e.g. give the dimension, range of years, and names of key variables).
```{r}
colnames(final_merged_data)
range(final_merged_data$year)
```

The dataset "pols-month" comprises 822 observations and 9 variables, providing insights into the political landscape in the United States. The variables include "mon" (date of the count), indicators for whether the president was Republican or Democratic ("prez_gop" and "prez_dem").
The dataset "snp" consists of 787 observations and 2 variables, focusing on the performance of the Standard & Poor's stock market index (S&P).
Lastly, the dataset "unemployment" encompasses 68 observations with 13 variables. It tracks unemployment percentages for each month of the year, from January to December, over multiple years. 
This merged dataset has 985 observation of 12 variables and combines political, economic, and stock market data from 1947 to 2015. The merged dataset contains columns "year", "month", "gov_gop", "sen_gop", "rep_gop", "gov_dem", "sen_dem", "rep_dem", "president", "day" , "close", "unemployment_rate"
